    <p>Hi, I'm Carson! And this is my EPIC personal website. I coded this entire thing in pure HTML and JS for fun (technically it was for a class but it was still enjoyable for me)</p>

    <p>Here's some of my interests!</p>

    <p>Game design and development are two of my biggest hobbies. I love the process of building something up from scratch and refining it until it's fun. You can try one of my games <a href="./games.html">Here!</a></p>

    <p>I also enjoy music production. I'm not super good at it yet but I'm very proud of what I've been making recently! Here's one of my songs</p>

    <audio controls src="/audio/nervend.ogg" type="audio/ogg"></audio>

    <p>3D modelling is something I've been getting into recently, and I personally enjoy it more than traditional 2d drawing. Here's a gif I made of my OC Prototype!</p>
