    <p>Linux is a set of operating systems built off the Linux Kernel, a modular program created in the early 90s by Linus Torvalds. Linux has grown beyond this, and is now used in super computers, website hosting, and thousands of phones and desktops.</p>
    <p>At it's core, Linux is based around user freedom and transparency. When you use Linux, you are able to make the system do whatever you want and have full control of every system function. Linux is not owned by a single entity either, due to it's open source nature everyone has the rights to do whatever they wish with Linux.</p>
