    <p>Distributions (or more commonly, distros) are different releases and derivations of Linux all maintained by different groups of people. Distros each contain the basic core libraries and commands of linux, but add their own layers on top of it in order to differentiate it. One distro could have an easy to grasp GUI installer alongside coming with utilities like a pdf reader or a browser, while another distro could give you to complete bare minimum and require you to install everything yourself.</p>
    <p>Distros can also be based off of other distros. For example, the biggest distro Ubuntu is based off of Debian. These 2 distros are very different, but they share a lot of features</p>
    <p>Distros usually come with a Desktop Enviornment. You can think of a Desktop Enviornment as the core featureset and look of a desktop. A majority of distros only give one option of Desktop Enviornment to install, but some of the more customizable distros can install with any Desktop Enviornment you wish.</p>

    <p>Here are some of the major distros!</p>
